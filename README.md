This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

     Hi, I am Hsu. I graduated from NTHU, majored in PME. And now I am also a master’s degree student of
department of PME. My research topic in the university is majorly on the mechanism design for 3D volumetric
displayer. Although my research topic for master program is not decided yet, its aspects will be emphasized
on “Image Processing and Analysis”.
     My hobby is exercising. Basketball and jogging is my favorite. I also enjoy movies and music.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
     As mentioned earlier, my research topic will focus on the field of “Image Processing and Analysis”.
However, I did not familiarize with the related knowledge or courses before. Therefore, I am eager to take
courses related to image such as “Computer Vision”. I hope to deeply learn the theorem and knowledge in this
field, which also provides benefits for my research in the near future.
     
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
     I am curious about every kind of topics of “Computer Vision” since I am not that familiar with
“Computer Vision”. However, I often see the awesome technique for human face detection and recognition
in movies. Something like the 3D image reconstruction of the street view of Google attracts me, too.
I quite want to know and learn how to do those works.
     
PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
